Lower interest rate: A private lender might be able to offer an interest rate that’s lower than the federal government’s interest rate.
Combination of several loans: Refinancing can allow you to consolidate several loans into one loan, ideally at a lower interest rate.
Lower monthly payments: A Parent PLUS loan might come with a 10-year payoff period. But a private lender might be able to offer a 20-year payoff period, which could reduce your monthly payments. It might also bump up the amount of interest you wind up paying over time.
Improved customer service: If you’re unhappy with how your loan is being managed, you might opt for finding a new lender that offers better customer service.
